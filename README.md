# simple-site
A simple, markdown-based website.

This is a place for me to test out a very simple method of deploying a static HTML site with pages written in markdown. Think like Jekyll or Hugo but much "dumber".

For my actual website source see [this repo][1].

## How it works

1. Fork this repo
2. Make sure github pages is turned on and the source is set to "Github Actions"
3. Put your markdown files in `./markdown`, make sure they end with `.md`
4. Commit them and push

## Custom CSS and Javascript

For those of you who really want to feel the pain, put your css in `./css/base.css` and your javascript in `./js/main.js`.
Both will get deployed with your static site and loaded for every page. Similarly, make sure they end with `.css` and `.js`,
respectively.

If you need more than one file, either get clever or edit `./templates/base.html` or `./templates/close.html`.

## Testing locally

Make sure you have `markdown` installed. You can get it from [the Markdown Homepage][2] or your favourite package manager probably.
Make sure you have a POSIX shell of some kind.

Execute `./convert.sh`, which builds your site in `_site`. You can then serve this directory however you see fit â€“ use the `file://`
protocol in your browser or a simple server like `python3 -m http.server`.

Things I may or may not do:
  * templates, or at least a bit more customization
  * github pages serving (DONE)
  * javascript (gasp) (DONE)
  * css (DONE)
  * tbd
