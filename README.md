# simple-site
A simple, markdown-based website.

This is a place for me to test out a very simple method of deploying a static HTML site with pages written in markdown. Think like Jekyll or Hugo but much "dumber".

For my actual website source see [this repo][1].

Things I may or may not do:
  * templates
  * github pages serving
  * javascript (gasp)
  * tbd
