# Perfect5th, 2.0

Hiya! I'm not sure what I'm actually going to use this site for, but it seems like a decent alt
to [my personal site][1], where I can dump less-structured content, TILs, and other faffery.

This site is based on [Simple Site][2], a very simple (*i.e.*, single `sh` script-based) static
site generator that turns markdown into HTML. I didn't really want or need anything fancy for this,
and producing this tool seemed like an easy way to get rid of a lot of cruft.

Feeling cute, might add RSS one day, here's an index of top-level pages that I've migrated from the
personal wiki I used to maintain.

 - [An AoC Intro to Haskell](haskell-aoc)
 - [Simple Site](simple-site.html)
