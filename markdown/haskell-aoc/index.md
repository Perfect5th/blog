# An AoC Intro to Haskell

## Last updated 2020-04-14

This may sound obvious, but I think one of the best ways to learn a programming language is to solve
problems with it. This works well when they are problems that you know you could solve in a language
you are more familiar with. That way, you spend most of your energy on the translation and less on
the problem solving.

To that end, I've decided to work through the [2019 Advent of Code][1] using Haskell, explaining
what I'm doing as I go. Let's see how far I manage to get before other things draw me away, or I
feel like it's no longer productive.

Most of these problems I've already solved in Python, C (urgh), or C++, so I'll more or less be
trying to translate my solutions and referring to them a bit. Let's go!
